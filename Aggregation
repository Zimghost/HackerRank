Revising Aggregations - The Count Function
Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100000.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM CITY
WHERE POPULATION > 100000;
-- COUNT function is the amount of times the condition occurs throughout the table.--

Revising Aggregations - The Sum Function
Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';
--SUM is the total amount of the data that is referenced in the condition.--

Revising Aggregations - Averages
Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';
-- AVG is a function that gets the average of the data that is querried under the condition.--

Average Population
Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(POPULATION))
FROM CITY;
-- ROUND can be used to round the function--

Japan Population
Query the sum of the populations for all Japanese cities in CITY. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.
SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';

Population Density Difference
Query the difference between the maximum and minimum populations in CITY.
SELECT MAX(POPULATION) - MIN(POPULATION)
FROM CITY;

Top Earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings 
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have 
maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
SELECT MAX(salary*months) AS TotalEarnings, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY (salary*months)
ORDER BY TotalEarnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- I was confused on the second part. Originally I did COUNT(MAX(salary*months), however I found out you can not do two aggregate functions together like that.
Therefore the way around it is to do COUNT (*) which would count all the data but only to group it by that (salary*months) so we only count the earners within 
that criteria.--

Weather Observation Station 2
Query the following two values from the STATION table:
The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),2), ROUND(SUM(LONG_W),2)
FROM STATION;
--Combining ROUND and SUM to get the sum of all the lat and long values then rounding them to exactly 2 decimals--

Weather Observation Station 13
Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345;
--ROUND and SUM functions with WHERE condition to get numbers BETWEEN two values.--

Weather Observation Station 14
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345;
--Not much to explain same concepts of using functions to narrow down the outcome.--

Weather Observation Station 15
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345
ORDER BY LAT_N DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- Query one column value based on criteria of another column.--

Weather Observation Station 16
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to  decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N),4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;

Weather Observation Station 17
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. 
Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780
ORDER BY LAT_N
LIMIT 1;

Weather Observation Station 18
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.
SELECT ROUND(ABS(MIN(LAT_N) - MAX(LAT_N)),4) + ROUND(ABS(MIN(LONG_W) - MAX(LONG_W)),4)
FROM STATION;
