Revising Aggregations - The Count Function
Query a count of the number of cities in CITY having a Population larger than 100000.

SELECT COUNT(*)

WHERE POPULATION > 100000;
-- COUNT function is the amount of times the condition occurs throughout the table.--

Revising Aggregations - The Sum Function
Query the total population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT SUM(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';
--SUM is the total amount of the data that is referenced in the condition.--

Revising Aggregations - Averages
Query the average population of all cities in CITY where District is California.

SELECT AVG(POPULATION)
FROM CITY
WHERE DISTRICT = 'California';
-- AVG is a function that gets the average of the data that is querried under the condition.--

Average Population

SELECT ROUND(AVG(POPULATION))
FROM CITY;

Top Earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings 
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have 
maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
SELECT MAX(salary*months) AS TotalEarnings, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY (salary*months)
ORDER BY TotalEarnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- I was confused on the second part. Originally I did COUNT(MAX(salary*months), however I found out you can not do two aggregate functions together like that.
Therefore the way around it is to do COUNT (*) which would count all the data but only to group it by that (salary*months) so we only count the earners within 
that criteria.--
