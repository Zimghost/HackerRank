Top Earners
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly salary x months worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings 
for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have 
maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.
SELECT MAX(salary*months) AS TotalEarnings, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY (salary*months)
ORDER BY TotalEarnings DESC
LIMIT 1;
-- I was confused on the second part. Originally I did COUNT(MAX(salary*months)
