Population Census
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the sum of the populations of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Asia'.
Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SELECT sum(city.population)
FROM City
Inner JOIN COUNTRY ON city.CountryCode = Country.Code
WHERE Continent = 'Asia'
--Simple JOIN query. I hope throughout I start to learn the difference between all the joins. With these exercises because I am
confused on the when to use LEFT,RIGHT, and FULL/CROSS JOIN.--

African Cities
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.

SELECT city.name
FROM City
Inner JOIN COUNTRY ON city.CountryCode = Country.Code
WHERE Continent = 'Africa'
--Same query as the last one aside from changing the criteria and what is being queried for. Same JOIN concept.--

Average Population of Each Continent
Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective 
average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

SELECT Country.continent, FLOOR(AVG(city.population))
FROM City
INNER JOIN Country ON city.countrycode = country.code
GROUP BY country.continent;
--I was using round, but I figured out that FLOOR is used specifically to round down no matter the integer. ROUND would
just round based on normal rounding criteria.--
