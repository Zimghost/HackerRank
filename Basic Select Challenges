Weather Observation Station 1
Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
SELECT CITY, STATE
FROM STATION;

Weather Observation Station 3
Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. 
Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.
SELECT  DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE mod(ID,2) = 0;
--Distinct means no duplicates and MOD calculates remainder--
--MOD = 0 shows results of remainder = 0 and <> 0 is not equal to 0.-- 

Weather Observation Station 4
Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY 
entries in the table.
SELECT COUNT(City) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)
FROM STATION;
--Don't forget the parentheses around the column--

Weather Observation Station 5
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths 
(i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, 
choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
(SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY),CITY
LIMIT 1)
UNION
(SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY Length(CITY) DESC,CITY
LIMIT 1);
--Start broad and then work your way to narrowing out the data.--

Weather Observation Station 6
Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%';
--This can be done differently using a WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u')--

Weather Observation Station 7
Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u';
-- This can be done differently using a WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u')--

Weather Observation Station 8
Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last 
characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u') AND RIGHT(CITY,1) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
--Using the last two examples I used the new methods to get the answer to this one.--

Weather Observation Station 9
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u');
-- I did not know about NOT IN which excludes what is in the parentheses.--

Weather Observation Station 10
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

Weather Observation Station 11
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u') OR RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

Weather Observation Station 12
Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. 
Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE LEFT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('A','E','I','O','U','a','e','i','o','u') AND RIGHT(CITY,1) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u')
--Similar answer however this uses the AND operator which excludes cities with vowels at start and end (ACME).
